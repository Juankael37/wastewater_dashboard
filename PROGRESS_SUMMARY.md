# Progress Summary — Wastewater Monitoring System

**Last updated:** April 15, 2026  

**Canonical status & next steps:** [`project_plan.md`](project_plan.md) · **Milestones & technical reference:** [`IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`](IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) · **Supabase + Cloudflare connect (done):** [`.cursor/plans/connect_supabase_+_cloudflare_cbd74acc.plan.md`](.cursor/plans/connect_supabase_+_cloudflare_cbd74acc.plan.md)

## What works

- **AquaDash (Flask):** dashboard, reports, exports (PDF with charts, CSV), alerts, settings — local / LAN.
- **React PWA:** login/register, dashboard, input, alerts, settings; **API base** from `VITE_API_URL`. When pointed at the **Cloudflare Worker**, core flows use **Supabase Auth** (JWT) and Worker routes (`/auth/*`, `/measurements`, `/plants`, `/parameters`, `/standards`, `/alerts`). Some features still call **Flask-style** `/api/*` paths (validation, reports, data tools); use Flask (`:5000`) as `VITE_API_URL` if you need those without the Worker implementing them yet.
- **LAN testing:** Vite dev server + LAN IP; for phone testing, ensure the API host you configure is reachable and CORS/`ALLOWED_ORIGINS` includes your origin.

## Checkpoint updates (Apr 15)

- Completed sprint items: #1 secrets hardening, #2 RBAC, #3 CORS hardening, #4 API capability gating, #5 offline queue fixes, #6 smoke-contract tests, #7 server-validated auth (`/auth/me`), #8 report path optimization, #9 runtime schema mutation removal, #10 DTO normalization.
- Worker parity (#11) is actively in progress and now includes compatibility routes for validation, report metrics, alerts dashboard, data count/clear, and user list/create.
- Settings now uses capability flags instead of backend URL heuristics; dev mode includes a backend-capabilities debug panel.
- Remaining parity gaps: Worker PDF/report artifact endpoint and safe user-delete workflow.

## Architecture (one line)

**Dual stack:** Flask + SQLite + AquaDash remain for rich exports and legacy admin APIs. **Target path for operators:** React PWA → **Cloudflare Worker** → **Supabase** (see `api/src/index.js`, `frontend/src/services/api.ts`). **Not done:** full parity on Worker for every Flask `/api/*` route; SQLite → Postgres migration; Google Sheets backup.

## Component checklist

| Component | Notes |
|-----------|--------|
| Flask backend | Operational for exports, validation, reports, data tools |
| React PWA | Worker + Supabase Auth when `VITE_API_URL` is the Worker; hybrid `/api/*` calls documented in `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` |
| Supabase | **Connect plan done:** schema applied, RLS for Worker; see plan + `supabase/migrations/` |
| Workers `api/` | **Connect plan done:** env/secrets, deploy, health `supabase_configured`; routes in `api/src/index.js` |
| Sheets backup | Guide only |
| Mobile / PWA hardening | Production build + real-device pass recommended |

---

## Technical debt (short)

- Tighten TypeScript types where still loose.
- Resolve **hybrid API**: implement missing routes on Worker, split env vars, or document dual-backend setup clearly.
- Camera + image upload vs Supabase Storage — validate E2E on production.
- Run E2E and mobile/offline tests from `PWA_TESTING_GUIDE.md`.

## Migration success (target stack)

Items **1–3** match the completed [connect Supabase + Cloudflare plan](.cursor/plans/connect_supabase_+_cloudflare_cbd74acc.plan.md) (schema, Worker + env, PWA `VITE_*`, RLS, smoke test). **4–6** remain product backlog.

1. [x] Supabase live (schema + auth + RLS per connect plan)  
2. [x] Workers deployed and callable from the PWA (`VITE_API_URL`)  
3. [x] PWA uses Supabase JWT + Worker for core CRUD (not Flask sessions for that path)  
4. [ ] SQLite → Postgres migration validated (if needed)  
5. [ ] Real-device PWA verification  
6. [ ] Google Sheets backup implemented
